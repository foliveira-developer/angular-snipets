app.component.ts

1 - A component is just a class. First thing should be done is exporting the class
export class ComponentName {

}

2 - Then we need to add a decorator so angular knows what type of class is this.
@Component()
//export class...

Although, angular does not know what is this, we need to add a import to access component
import {Component} from '@angular/core';

Now @Component() knows what is this, yet we need to configurate it

selector will be the id to be used in other component as an HTML tag
templateUrl: This external file will hold the html code of this component. Path starts in app folder

@Component({
	selector: 'app-componentName',
	templateUrl: './componentName.component.html'
})

Component decorator has (@Component):
 - selector: string as a value (tag identifier used in index.html so angular knows to translate the tag to the component.html)
