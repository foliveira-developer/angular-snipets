Modules are used to bundle components in packages
Only bigger projects might interest use more than one app module

This module has a decorator named NgModule.
This as the following configurations:

 declarations: Components to be used
 bootstrap: Default component run on start up

 NOTE: By default Angular will not read all the files. Thats why we need to declare new components in declarations config
 NOTE: Components in declarations need to be imported (ignore the extension like .ts)
