DataBinding is comunication, between the TypeScript and the template (HTML)

There are 3 types of binding:

Output data
    String Interpolation {{ data }} - Use it for printing values in the DOM
    Porperty Binding: [property]="data" - Use if for changing property values of CSS

Event binding (React to User Events
    Event Binding (event) = "expressing" - Use it to do logic on button click

Combination: Two way databinding
    [(ngModel)]="data" - Use it to update data in TypeScript and also in DOM. ngModel is smart and uses the key events (e.g. using in a <input> will update on typing)
